# E-commerce RESTful API using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core

## Introduction:
This project is a comprehensive RESTful API for a fictional e-commerce platform that includes features such as product catalog management, customer registration and authentication, order management, and a shopping cart. The API was implemented using ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core was used for the data access layer.

## Objective:
This project was undertaken to demonstrate my ability to design and implement complex APIs and to deepen my understanding of ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.

## Technologies Used:
ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, Visual Studio, Postman (for API testing).

## Features:
User Registration and Authentication, Product Catalog Management, Order Management, and Shopping Cart. Briefly explain what each feature does.

## Code Snippets:
Include some snippets of your most crucial or innovative pieces of code, such as a complex query or a unique algorithm.

## Challenges and Learnings:
Discuss any significant challenges you faced during the project and how you overcame them. Also, write about new concepts or techniques you learned during this project.

## Results:
Discuss the final outcome of the project. For example, the API's successful response to all test cases, or how it could handle a specific number of requests per second.

## Future Scope:
Suggest potential improvements or features that could be added in the future.

## Project Link:
Include a link to the project on GitHub or another platform where viewers can see your code.
